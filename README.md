# jane-international-school website


A **modern school website** built with [Next.js], **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This project is my playground for experimenting with frontend development, animations, and page structures.  
It currently runs only on the **frontend** (no backend integration yet), but I’d love to expand it in the future with backend features. 🚀
